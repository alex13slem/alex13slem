# Senior Full-stack Engineer

I develop modern, reliable, and scalable web applications. I focus on clear architecture, predictable data flows, and maintainable codebases. My work is centered around TypeScript, modular frontend architectures, and backend systems with clean data models.

**Core focus areas**
- Full-stack development with modern JavaScript / TypeScript
- Architecture and system design
- ERP and business process automation
- AI & workflow integrations

## Current Work — BSO Real Estate Management

I build and improve a multi-tenant property management platform used by real estate companies and landlords.  
The system connects operational workflows (leases, tenants, maintenance, payments) with internal business logic and financial accounting.

**Key responsibilities**
- Full-stack architecture (Next.js + NestJS)
- Domain modeling and typed API contracts
- Performance & data consistency across distributed modules

**ERPNext Integration**
- Bidirectional synchronization of leases, tenants, units, portfolios, and payments
- Cheque lifecycle automation (deposit / return / exchange / RDC pipeline)
- Document/OCR processing for RERA contracts
- Role-based access control using Supabase Auth + RLS
- Typed validation layers (Zod) to ensure consistency at sync boundaries

This results in a unified platform where:
- the **admin panel**,  
- the **client portal**,  
- and **ERPNext backend**  
operate on a shared, validated data model.
